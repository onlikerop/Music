[00:17.82]Like it's the 1st semester
[00:19.03]Rock it like Queen when I'm under pressure
[00:21.03]While the rest of these cats, all siesta
[00:23.10]I get loose like change when it's on your dresser
[00:25.26]Boom, here comes the real volume
[00:27.35]Loud enough to wake up and shake this tomb
[00:29.37]I connect like skate decks in concrete rooms
[00:31.64]You're about to face what makes this move

[00:33.57]People used to tell me that I'm on my own
[00:36.88]They said I'd never make a difference on this microphone
[00:40.98]'Cause there's a million other people who could sing this song
[00:45.17]I said "Well, thanks for the push 'cause you all were wrong"

[01:09.24]Dig it like rust corrosion
[01:10.57]When it goes in gush like a busted nose and
[01:12.64]Competitors
[01:13.84]I was born to set it off
[01:14.88]They wrapped me in cloth
[01:15.84]I grabbed a mic and went on tour
[01:16.91]Smash it
[01:17.71]Back in school I was a hazard
[01:18.93]Cause I never saw the grass
[01:20.01]Never just looked past it
[01:21.08]Had a passion that burned like battery acid
[01:23.14]Peter Parker, bit by some radioactive
[01:25.25](Shake this place in)

[02:23.14](Feel the movement, feel the pressure)
[02:25.22]If you wanna rise up start with me
[02:29.37]If you wanna stand up here's one for free
